In this challenge, you need to use the tool "curl" to interact with a specific webpage, which is only accessible through your Azure Lab VM.

The first time you interact, the webpage will tell you which message to hash using MD5. You need to interact with the page again, passing the MD5 hash as the GET parameter "hash".
